The password to your email address is the most essential tool that you have for protecting your valuable information. If an intruder gets access to your email by using your password, the intruder has access to your complete digital footprint, including resetting passwords for other sites associated with your email.

To protect your Rackspace Email mail account from intruders, regularly change your email password. Use the following instructions to change your password:

**Note**: We recommend that you create a password that you have never used before and that remains unique from all your other passwords. Also, the longer your password, the more secure your account is.

1. Log in to your Webmail account at [apps.rackspace.com](https://apps.rackspace.com).

2. In the top-right corner, click the account's username and then select **Settings**.

3. In the left pane, click **Change Password**.

     <img src="{% asset_path rackspace-email/change-your-rackspace-email-password/step3.png %}"/>

4. Enter your current password and then enter the new password.

5. Click **Save**.

After changing your password, remember to update it on your mobile device and any email clients that use the Rackspace Email account.
