This article helps you set up Office 365 for Rackspace Cloud Office.

To get started, make sure you're logged in to [Cloud Office](https://cp.rackspace.com). Then, on the Cloud Portal home page, click **Manage Office 365**.

### Create your tenant ID

1. Enter a tenant name.

    A tenant is a unique name for your organization within the Office 365 Portal. Your tenant name forms your Office 365 User ID and, if you have one, the address of your SharePoint site.  A tenant is not a domain.

    Use only letters and numbers for your tenant name.

    If your tenant ID is valid and available, a green checkbox appears next to the name field.

2. Enter a user name.

3. Enter a password and confirm it.

    **This password is temporary.** The Office 365 portal will prompt you to create a new password when you first visit the site.

The tenant name, user name, and password you enter in Rackspace Cloud Office form your Office 365 User ID. For example, if you create a tenant:

    `Tenant: mycompany.onmicrosoft.com`
    `Username: admin`
    `Password: Password1`

Enter the following when you log in to the Office 365 Portal:

    `Email: admin@mycompany.onmicrosoft.com`
    `Password: Password1`

4. Enter company information.

    All fields are required. You can change your information later on the Microsoft Office 365 Portal.

5. Click **Create Tenant**.

### Add a subscription

From the [Cloud Portal Office 365 manager](https://cp.rackspace.com/Office365#/Manage), click **Add Subscription**.

1. Select a plan.

    Read more about [different plans](https://www.rackspace.com/office-365) for Office 365.

2. Enter the number of licenses you need.

3. Click **Add Subscription**.

Pending subscriptions display yellow in the subscription list. Active subscriptions display green.

#### Add-on plans

Add-ons become available after you add a subscription. Add-ons appear below your subscription list.

Click an add-on to see a description and confirm its addition to your service. Note that add-on pricing is per license.

*Email Archiving* is currently available as an add-on for all subscriptions. *Extra SharePoint Storage* will be available in December 2015 for plans with SharePoint.

#### Manage your subscription

Click the gear icon for your subscription to manage its features.

To change the number of licenses for your subscription, click **Edit License Quantity...** to select a different number, then click **Save**.

To delete your subscription, click **Suspend/Delete** and click **Suspend Subscription** to confirm.

**Note**: Suspended subscriptions retain your data for 60 days before being permanently deleted. You will not be billed while a subscription is suspended.

### Log in to the Office 365 portal

From the [Cloud Portal Office 365 manager](https://cp.rackspace.com/Office365#/Manage), click **Log in to Office 365 Control Panel**.

1. Enter your email and password.

    Enter the tenant ID you created in Cloud Office. For example:

        `Email: admin@my-company.onmicrosoft.com`
        `Password: Password1`

When you first log in, the Office 365 Portal requires you to enter and confirm a new password.

#### Success!

You're ready to put Office 365 to work with Rackspace Cloud Office.
