This tutorial shows the basic steps for setting up the W3 Total Cache plug-in to work with Rackspace Cloud Files. Cloud Files uses a *push* content delivery network (CDN), which automatically uploads the content from your primary web server and stores the data on Cloud Files. The benefits of a push CDN are more space on your local server's disk and scaling more servers without having to keep your user-generated content in sync.

**Note:** Push CDNs work better for sites that frequently experience surges in traffic that might require servers to scale up or down. If your site experiences consistently moderate to high levels of traffic, see [Configure W3 Total Cache for WordPress with Rackspace CDN](/how-to/configure-w3-total-cache-for-wordpress-with-rackspace-cdn).

8. Click **Save all settings**.

### Configure the CDN

1. In the WordPress navigation menu, click **Performance > CDN**.

2. In the **Configuration** section, click **Authorize**.

   A pop-up box appears with guided steps to configure your CDN.

3. Enter your Rackspace cloud account username and API key, and then click **Next**.

   **Note:** If you need help finding your API key, see [View and reset your API key](/how-to/view-and-reset-your-api-key).

4. Select the region in which you want to host the files for your website, and then click **Next**.

   **Note:** This should be the same region where your cloud resources are located.

5. Create a new Cloud Files container by entering a unique name that you will remember.

   This name is primarily used to help you quickly identify the container in the Rackspace Cloud Control Panel.

6. Click **Apply** to save and apply your settings.

7. In the **General** section, select the check box next to each type of content that you want to host on the CDN, and then click **Save all settings**.

### Set up a CNAME record (optional)

Set up a CNAME record to give your content links a human-readable name.

1. In the WordPress navigation menu, click **Performance > CDN**.

1. In the **Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

   a. Copy the **http** and **https** URLs from the **CDN host (CNAME target)** section. You will need this information when you add the DNS record in the Cloud Control Panel.
   b. Leave the **SSL support** set to the default **Auto** option.
   c. Enter any common subdomain that you want in the **Replace site's hostname with:** box, and click **Add CNAME**.
   d. Click **Save all settings**.

3. In the top navigation bar, click **Networking > Cloud DNS**.

5. In the pop-up dialog box, enter the following information:

   - **Record Type**: Select CNAME Record from the drop-down menu.
   - **Hostname**: Enter the hostname that you created in the step 1.
   - **Target (Domain)**: Paste the **http** and **https** URLs that you copied in step 1.
   - **Time to Live (TTL)**: Choose an appropriate TTL value for your site needs.
