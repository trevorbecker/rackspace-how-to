[Rackspace Private Cloud Powered by Openstack](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/private/openstack)
allows you to install an OpenStack private cloud, configured as recommended by
Rackspace OpenStack specialists.

Rackspace Private Cloud Powered by OpenStack uses Ansible to create an
OpenStack cluster on Ubuntu Linux. The installation process provides a
familiar approach for Linux system administrators, and the environment
can be updated easily without downloading and installing a new ISO.

Documentation for Rackspace Private Cloud is available
[here](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/#docs-private-cloud ) and

Developer documentation for the community
