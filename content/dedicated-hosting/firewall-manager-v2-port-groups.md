The Firewall Manager v2 is a new tool within the MyRackspace portal. This article describes the port-group feature within this tool. 

Click here to learn more about the [Firewall Manager v2](https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/firewall-manager-v2).

### What is a port-group?
Before a port-group can be explained, an object-group must be defined. Object-groups are used to group like items together, such as IP addresses, ports, or protocols. Object-groups are commonly used to make the configuration of a firewall's access-list more easily readable and controlled, which assists in support and troubleshooting. 

As stated above, _a port-group is a form of an object-group_. A port-group is a single configuration item that logically groups ports together. The benefit to using a port-group is that you can reference a port-group in access-list entries that have object-groups as well! This is better than the alternative of having to create individual access-list entries for each component of the port-group. A powerful example of efficient use of port-groups is if you had a single access-list entry references an object-group of 100 source IPs, an object-group of 10 destination IPs, and a port-group of 5 TCP ports. Using the object-group and port-group strategy, your firewall's running configuration only requires one access-list entry. If you did not use object and port-groups, this would require **5,000 access-list entries** in the running configuration, individually specifying each unique source IP, destination IP, and TCP port. 

**Note:** The Firewall Manager v2 only allows you to create port-groups using TCP or UDP ports.

### Why should I use a port-group?

With the example above, you can easily see the organizational and readability impact port-groups can have on a Cisco firewall's running configuration. Remember, the easier a firewall's running configuration is to read and modify, the chances for a misconfiguration are reduced, and the quicker it can be troubleshot when issues arise.

### Port-groups in the Firewall Manager v2

In the Firewall Manager v2, you now have the ability to view, modify, or delete any port-group on your firewall. In the previous version of the Firewall Manager, the user was restricted to only modifying port-groups that began with the string "_FWCP-_". In this new version of the Firewall Manager, this restriction has been lifted, which enables you to more powerfully control and modify your environment.

**Location of Port-groups**

1. Log in to the Firewall Manager v2 using the steps in the [Firewall Manager v2](https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/firewall-manager-v2) "How do I find the Firewall Manager v2?" section.

2. Select the correct firewall from the list on the left by clicking on it.

3. Click the **Port Groups** tab on the left drop down menu.

### Viewing Port-groups

Navigate to the **_Port Groups_** tab. Scroll or search through the port-group list and select the appropriate port-group by clicking on it. The contents of the port-group will automatically display in the next column to the right. You may need to scroll to the top depending on the amount of port-groups configured on your firewall.

The Firewall Manager v2 organizes the port-groups that exist on your firewall in case-sensitive, alphabetical order. This means that oport-groups titled in uppercase are displayed before the lowercase port-groups. If you are having a difficult time locating the port-group, perform a find within your browser, and search for the port-group.

The Firewall Manager v2 also now allows you to search through the contents of a port-group. This feature enables you to quickly identify if a TCP or UDP port exists within the specified port-group. To use this feature, type a TCP or UDP port number into the search bar that automatically displays in the right column once you click on the port-group to select it.

### Creating Port-groups

Navigate to the **_Port Groups_** tab. Click on the **_add group_** button that is displayed below the Port Groups title. The Firewall Manager v2 will interactively display the **_Add Group_** page.

1. Type the name of the port-group in the **_Group Name_** field. 

    The Rackspace naming scheme best practice is to use all capital letters with dashes seperating words. We recommend making the name of a port-group directly related to what access this port-group will grant. For example, if a port-group were being configured to have TCP ports 80 and 443 inside it, we would recommend you call this port-group "**_TCP-80-443_**". By clearly and appropriately naming the port-group, you reduce your risk of misconfiguration in the future, which could mistakenly result in a compromise if undesired access is opened.

2. In the **_Protocol_** field, select one of the following three options: TCP, UDP, or TCP-UDP. The last option is used if you would like to add both TCP and UDP in one configuration action.

3. Click the **_Add Port(s)_** button to add the ports to the port-group. 

    In the text field, type a single port number, or enter a list of port numbers, with each unique item on their own line.
    
    **Warning:** You also have the ability to add a port range by seperating two values with a dash (-). Using this feature will add all port numbers inbetween the two values you specified around the dash. Misconfiguration here can result in a compromise due to inappropriate ports being opened.
    
4. Click the **_Add Port_** button.  

5. Click the **_Save Changes_** button. The Firewall Manager v2 will interact with your firewall and add the configurations. This will typically take one minute or less, depending on the size of your firewall's configuration.

### Modifying Port-groups

Navigate to the **_IP Groups_** tab. Scroll or search through the object-group list and select the appropriate object-group by clicking on it. The contents of the object-group will automatically display in the next column to the right. You may need to scroll to the top depending on the amount of object-groups configured on your firewall.

1. Click the **_Edit Group_** button the modify the contents of an object-group.

2. Adding an entry - Click the **_Add IP(s)_** button to add IP hosts or subnet ranges to the object-group. See the notes above in the _Creating Object-groups_ section above.

3. Removing an entry - Click on the **_minus symbol_** to the right of the object-group entry.

4. Click the **_Save Changes_** button. The Firewall Manager v2 will interact with your firewall and add the configurations. This will typically take 30 seconds, depending on the size of your firewall's configuration.

   **Note:** If is highly important that you understand the impact of modifying an object-group. Incorrectly modifying an object-group that is referenced in an access-list has the potential to either creating inappropriate network access or removing critical access. Always ensure that you fully understand the impact of your modification.

### Deleting Object-groups

Navigate to the **_IP Groups_** tab. Scroll or search through the object-group list and select the appropriate object-group by clicking on it. The contents of the object-group will automatically display in the next column to the right. You may need to scroll to the top depending on the amount of object-groups configured on your firewall.

1. Click the **_Delete Group_** button make a request to remove an object-group.

2. A ticket will be submitted on your behalf for a Racker to manaually remove the object-group and delete any configuration items that reference the object-group, such as access-lists, VPN encryption domains, or even other object-groups.

3. This ticket will be automatically forward to the appropriate Network Security team. A Racker will perform quality checks and confirm with you directly if anything appears to be incorrect.
