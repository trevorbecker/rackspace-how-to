### Other packages

Although we don't support all technologies, we do offer reasonable-endeavor
support which extends our support into offering alternative solutions.
Reasonable-endeavor support can include help from Rackspace partners and other
third party services.

-   **Load Balancing:** Support is provided through the use of Cloud
    Load Balancers.

-   **Email:** Support is provided through Rackspace Email and using
    IIS SMTP on the server. Cloud servers with the Managed Operations
    service Level are preconfigured to use Mailgun, our mail relay service,
    to ensure reliable mail delivery. The first 50,000 emails sent each
    month are free, and your mail package can be upgraded if higher volume
    is expected. For more details see the [Mailgun Rackspace pricing
    page](http://www.mailgun.com/rackspace).

-   **DNS:** The use of the Rackspace Cloud name servers for DNS
    is supported. Windows DNS is currently not supported.

-   **Exchange:** Exchange is not supported at this time.

-   **SharePoint:** SharePoint is not supported at this time.

-   **Terminal Services:** We will install the role and license.

-   **Cloud Files:** Integration with Cloud Files is supported by using the
    API; however, no development assistance with using the API is provided.

### End-of-life support dates

Rackspace makes every effort to align our support dates for operating
systems with the manufacturer's support dates. The end-of-life support
dates listed are provided by the manufacturer and are subject to change.
If the manufacturer decides to shorten the support life of an
operating system, Rackspace might be forced to end support sooner than the
published date.

| Operating system name | End-of-life support date |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Windows Server 2008 R2 | January 14, 2020 |
| Windows Server 2012 R2 | January 10, 2023 |
