Welcome to Rackspace Cloud Servers!  This guide provides you with
everything you will need to get started; from logging into our [Control Panel](http://manage.rackspacecloud.com), creating servers, transferring
domains to be hosted from your Cloud Server, and logging in to your
server.

The following concepts will help you in getting started quickly:

-   Cloud Servers are a cloud& computing utility and not traditional
    hosting; this means customers are given administrative access to
    virtual private servers that can be easily built and just as easily
    taken down.
-   Cloud Servers can resize capacity as your need changes. Billing is
    charged by number of hours of use at a given rate for the size of
    server being used. [Current Pricing](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cloud_hosting_products/servers/pricing/).
-   Customers will have root access to Linux servers and Administrator
    access to Windows servers.
-   The virtual servers are accessible through a remote connection
    client like Remote Desktop (Windows) or an ssh client (Linux). Both
    Windows and Linux servers will be accessible through a web console
    from our Control Panel as well.
-   Customers can manage Cloud Servers through the [Control Panel](https://manage.rackspacecloud.com), or an
    [API](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/)(Application Programming Interface).
-   The hardware that hosts your Cloud Server can be located
    in: Dallas/Ft. Worth, TX - Chicago, IL - or in London, England
    ([UK](http://www.rackspace.co.uk/cloud-hosting/cloud-products/cloud-servers/)).
