The [Cloud Control Panel](http://mycloud.rackspace.com/) gives you GUI access to all of your Rackspace services, but sometimes you might want to manage your assets through a scripting interface like the API. (See our [catalog of APIs](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/) for reference.)

Before you can start using Rackspace APIs, you need to have your API key. Your API key is a unique alphanumeric identifier associated with your account that is used for universal authentication commands for all of your services.

### To view or reset your API key

**Note:** When you reset your API key, any third-party applications are disconnected until you set the new API key in your application. If you are using your API key as a part of a server code with a site or application, the site or application will also break and could potentially affect your day-to-day operations. We recommend updating your API key for any application to which you connected with the previous API key.

1.	In the upper-right corner of the Cloud Control Panel, click the ***userName*** menu and select **My Profile & Settings**.

2.  Scroll down to **Security Settings**.

3.	To view your API key, click the **Show** link next to **Rackspace API Key**. You can copy the API key from this screen.

4.	To reset your API key, follow these steps.

    A. Click the **Reset** link next to **Rackspace API Key**.    

    B. In the confirmation window, click **Generate New Key**. Your new key is displayed.
