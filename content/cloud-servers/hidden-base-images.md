To provide the best experience possible for our customers, we carefully maintain the list of images that can be used to build a new cloud server. Older versions of an operating system are occasionally removed from the default list, usually shortly after a newer version is released. In general, the list displays the most current version and at least one previous version of each operating system that we support.

Images that have been publicly released are never actually deleted, just hidden. You can access these older images by referencing the image ID directly through the Cloud Servers API.  If you're looking for an older version of a Linux distro or Windows Server, use this article to find the image ID for that version..

**Warning:** These older images are no longer maintained and might not contain the most up-to-date patches and package updates.
