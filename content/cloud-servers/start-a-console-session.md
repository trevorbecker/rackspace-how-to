As the administrator for your cloud servers, you might need to occasionally log in to one of your servers by using the Console feature in the Cloud Control Panel.

### To access the Console

1.  Log in to the [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com) and click **Servers > Cloud Servers** in the top navigation bar.
2.  Click on the name of your server to open the details page.
3.  From the Actions menu, select **Emergency Console**.

A terminal emulator window opens and displays your server's console. If you see a blank screen, hit Enter to bring up a login prompt or Windows desktop.

If you get a security error message from Java, you might need to add the console URL to Java's security exceptions list.  For more information, see [How can I configure the Exception Site List?](http://java.com/en/download/faq/exception_sitelist.xml)

### Working in the console

The top row of the console displays functions that you can use during a Console session.

- Click the Options button to open the XVP Viewer Options dialog box, in which you can modify certain display and interface options.

- Click the Clipboard button to open the XVP Viewer Clipboard dialog box, which provides a convenient location to copy and paste lines of text.

- Select the Ctrl or Alt check boxes while choosing an F key from the Fx list to emulate the corresponding keyboard functions in the Console.

- For Windows servers, click the Ctrl-Alt-Del button to send an interrupt command to the server.

- Click the Refresh button to refresh the Console screen.

- The Shutdown and Reboot buttons are inactive by default. When you are logged in to your server as root/administrator or as a user with those privileges, those buttons become active.

### Closing the console

Before closing the console, log out of your account to ensure that the account is not active the next time a user connects to your server's Console.

You can disconnect the Console from your server by clicking the Disconnect button to end the session.
