**Note:** This article is written for our [Cloud Sites Control Panel](https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/). You can get to it from the [Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com) by clicking **Rackspace Cloud** in the upper-left corner and selecting **Cloud Sites**. You can also navigate directly to <https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/>.

Rackspace Cloud accepts cancellations via the cancellation form located
in the control panel. Cancellations that are submitted via email, phone,
or chat are not accepted.

Before you submit a cancellation request, create a backup of your website, database,
and email. If you are running a cloud server, you must delete the server to stop billing. All data is removed
from our systems when we process the account closure. If you want your data removed immediately, complete the deletion process before submitting a cancellation request.</span>

### To cancel your account

1.  Log in to the [Cloud Sites Control Panel](https://manage.rackspacecloud.com/).
2.  Click **Your Account**, and then click **Cancel Account**.
3.  Complete the cancellation form, and then click **Submit**.

Allow 48-72 hours for your request to be processed. If you have any questions, please submit a ticket with the cancellation request, as these cannot be handled over the phone or in chat.
