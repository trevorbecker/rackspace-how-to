I had to keep going back since there was no pause button but easy, 10 min training that helps anyone get started with contributing to support/how to articles.
Consideration for how people will come across this training; a lot of people will come from the one.rackspace wiki. Having links to this GitHub page along with next-steps on what to do to gain access (go to this GitHub proj and watch the training video, etc)
Finally can update all this out of date documentation
